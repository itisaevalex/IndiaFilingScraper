# CLAUDE.md — India Securities Filing Scraper

## Mission

Reverse-engineer and scrape India's securities filing systems. Extract filings (annual reports, prospectuses, financial statements) from Indian regulatory portals into structured JSON + downloaded documents.

This is part of a multi-country financial filings scraper project. Sibling scrapers exist for Canada (SEDAR+, task2/) and Mexico (CNBV STIV-2, task1/).

## Methodology — Lessons from Previous Scrapers

The following methodology was developed across two successful scraper projects (Canada SEDAR+ and Mexico CNBV). Follow this playbook — it saves days of wasted effort.

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (DO THIS FIRST)

1. **Identify the tech stack** — what backend (ASP.NET? Java? Oracle? React SPA?) and what WAF/bot protection (Cloudflare, Radware, Akamai, Azure WAF, etc.)
2. **Check response headers** — `Server`, `X-Powered-By`, cookie names reveal the stack
3. **Inspect the page source** — look for framework-specific patterns:
   - ASP.NET: `__VIEWSTATE`, `__EVENTVALIDATION`, `ScriptManager`
   - Oracle Catalyst: `viewInstanceKey`, `_CBNAME_`, `_VIKEY_`
   - DevExpress: `dxgvDataRow`, `ASPxClientCallbackPanel`, `WebForm_DoCallback`
   - React/Vue SPA: API calls in Network tab, no server-rendered HTML
4. **Test plain curl** — does it work? Does it redirect to a captcha/challenge page?
5. **Check robots.txt** — what's disallowed?

**Note:** NSE (nseindia.com) is known to have aggressive bot protection — it may require curl_cffi or browser cookies. BSE tends to be more accessible. Start with BSE.

### Phase 2: GitHub Research (BEFORE writing any code)

1. Run `gh search repos` and `gh search code` for the target site
2. Look for existing scrapers, partial reverse-engineering, API documentation
3. Check if anyone has documented the protocol or found bypasses
4. **This saved days on both SEDAR+ and CNBV** — prior art existed for both

### Phase 3: HTTP Library Selection

Test different HTTP libraries against the target. Results vary dramatically by site:

| Library | When it works | When it fails |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| `requests` | No TLS fingerprinting (Mexico CNBV worked with just `requests`) | Radware, Cloudflare, Akamai |
| `curl_cffi` | TLS fingerprint-sensitive WAFs (Canada SEDAR+ needed this) | Some sites reject impersonation |
| `httpx` | HTTP/2 required sites | Same TLS issues as requests |
| `tls_client` | Theoretically good TLS, Go-based | Radware rejected it despite browser TLS |

**Key insight from SEDAR+:** If plain requests gets blocked, try `curl_cffi` with `impersonate="chrome120"` before jumping to browser automation. It bypasses JA3/JA4 TLS fingerprinting which is the most common first layer.

### Phase 4: Use Playwright as a DEBUGGING TOOL, not the scraper

**Critical lesson from both projects:** Use Playwright to capture real browser traffic, then replicate with raw HTTP.

```python
# Connect to real Chrome via CDP for maximum trust
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
browser = pw.chromium.connect_over_cdp("http://127.0.0.1:9222")

# Or launch headless for quick capture
browser = pw.chromium.launch(headless=True)
```

What to capture:
- **Network requests** — exact headers, POST bodies, cookie values
- **XHR/Fetch calls** — these reveal the actual API the frontend uses
- **JavaScript callbacks** — frameworks often prepend prefixes or transform data before sending

**Mexico example:** DevExpress silently prepends `c0:` to callback params. Without Playwright capture, this was invisible and caused a .NET exception. One Playwright session revealed the exact format.

**Canada example:** CDP connection to real Chrome revealed that stormcaster.js cookies from real Chrome sessions enable pure HTTP pagination. Headless Playwright's cookies were rejected.

### Phase 5: Understand the State Machine

Most government portals use server-side state machines. Key patterns:

**ASP.NET WebForms (Mexico):**
- `__VIEWSTATE` and `__EVENTVALIDATION` must be sent with every POST
- ViewState encodes the server's UI state — wrong ViewState = wrong results
- Async postback (`ScriptManager`) vs sync POST produce different ViewStates
- ViewState from sync POST may not support subsequent AJAX operations

**Oracle Catalyst (Canada):**
- `_VIKEY_`, `_CBNAME_`, `_CBVALUE_` control the state machine
- Pagination is sequential only (1→2→3, no jumping)
- Node IDs change between responses — must re-extract from each response
- **State invalidation:** paginating destroys previous page's resource URLs

**General rule:** The server remembers what page you're on. If you skip steps or send stale state tokens, you get garbage back.

### Phase 6: Download Pattern

**Download-before-paginate** (learned the hard way on SEDAR+):
- Some frameworks invalidate resource URLs when you navigate away
- Always download documents from the current page BEFORE moving to the next
- Within a single page, downloads CAN be parallelized (thread pool)
- Cross-page parallelism often DOES NOT work

**Enc/token caching** (learned on CNBV):
- If download URLs use encrypted tokens, cache them in SQLite
- Tokens are often deterministic and permanent — resolve once, use forever
- This turns a 2-request-per-file flow into a 1-request-per-file flow

### Phase 7: Rate Limiting & Bot Protection

| Protection | Detection | Bypass |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| TLS fingerprinting | 403/redirect on plain requests | curl_cffi with browser impersonation |
| JavaScript challenge | Redirect to challenge page | Real browser cookies via CDP |
| IP reputation | Datacenter IPs blocked | Residential IP required |
| Cookie validation | Requests without cookies blocked | Harvest from real browser session |
| Rate limiting | 429 or connection pool exhaustion | Add delays, limit concurrency |
| WAF headers | Missing Sec-Fetch-* etc. | Copy exact browser headers |

**Key insight:** Bot protection layers are cumulative. You may pass TLS but fail cookie validation. Test each layer independently.

### Phase 8: Production Architecture

Target architecture (proven on both projects):
```
Session init (one-time, <10s)
  → Pure HTTP crawl (requests or curl_cffi)
    → Parse HTML (BeautifulSoup + lxml)
      → Download documents (parallel within page)
        → Cache to SQLite (dedup + tracking)
```

- **No browser in the loop** — browsers use 2-3GB RAM each, HTTP uses ~5MB
- **SQLite for everything** — filings cache, download tracking, enc token cache
- **Headless Chrome as fallback only** — for when IP gets flagged or session init fails

## Output Format

Match the existing project structure:
```
scraper.py              # Main scraper (crawl, monitor, export, stats)
requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
filings_cache.db        # SQLite cache (auto-generated)
documents/              # Downloaded files (auto-generated)
filings.json            # Exported filings (via export command)
_investigation/         # Reverse-engineering artifacts
README.md               # Documentation with full RE journey
```

## Commands to Support

```bash
python scraper.py crawl --max-pages 10 --download
python scraper.py monitor --interval 300 --download
python scraper.py export --output filings.json
python scraper.py stats
```

## Investigation Artifacts

Save ALL reverse-engineering work in `_investigation/`:
- Network captures, decoded responses
- Hypothesis test scripts (`exp_*.py`, `h1-h5_*.py`)
- Deobfuscated JavaScript if relevant
- Protocol documentation

This evidence is invaluable for debugging when things break later.
